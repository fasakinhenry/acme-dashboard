## <a name="overview"> 👀 Overview</a>

The Acme Dashboard SaaS is a web application built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to provide users with a comprehensive dashboard experience, featuring various components such as charts, tables, and user profiles. It is basically a dashboard that allows users to see various metrics and data visualizations about recent revenue and latest invoices. It also has a sidebar for navigation and Invoices page with pagination where users can create, view, search, edit, and delete invoices. It has features like skeletal loading and optimistic UI updates to enhance user experience.

The purpose of this project is to get the hang of Next.js App Router by building a functional dashboard application. It is a complete SAAS that has landing page, authentication, dashboard, invoices management, and more.
